# KernelTimeMachine
A safe 3DS downgrader using TTP files.<br>
<br>
This is still a WIP.<br>
Please note that there might be some typos and mistakes due to the fact that I'm not using an IDE and did not try to compile it yet. It shouldn't work yet. Please note that the main file is pretty big for now, and will probably get splitted up later on.
